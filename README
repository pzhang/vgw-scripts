Normal operation :
   point db_insert_data.rb at folder that contains data, and it will search for
   the defined search term.  All of this can be done in the config file
   import_data.yml .
   
   running generate_all.rb will generate the graphs and webpages for today,
   this week, and this month.  Giving it one command line argument custom
   generates day, week, month data for the date given.  Two commands specifies
   a start date and end date.

Adding different reporting:

   The import_data config has a definition of regexes and the user can define
   categories of data that is to be parsed from the regexes.  However, if a new
   category is added, the corresponding column in the database table must be
   made as well.

   Define a broad config for the new report in the generate_all.yml config file
   such as where this report's config file is, where to put the output as well 
   as the source and time periods(day, week, and/or month) desired.
   
   In the individual config files, the user defines the graphing options to 
   be set as well as the various data handling options.  See the configuration
   files for more details.
